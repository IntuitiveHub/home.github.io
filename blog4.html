                <h1>How is it like being an intp</h1><br>
                <p>
                    A few months ago, I learned about the website
                    <a href="https://16personalities.com">16personalities</a> which allows users to analyse their personality traits and rate them on a scale of 0 to 100.</p>
                <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base-content/master/files/16personalities.png" alt="persona" height="500px">
                <br><br>
                <p>As the blog's title suggests, I learned that I am an INTP-T according to the website.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    "A Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness
                    to experiment with personal creativity."
                    <br>-16personalities
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>Logicians feel proud in their differing perspectives and strong rational thoughts. They can't help but be perplexed by the universe's mysteries, which also explains why Logicians have been among the most prominent scientists and philosophers
                    of all time. </p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p> I have pursued several hobbies throughout my life as an INTP, but only a few that  have lasted to the present. </p>
                <p>
                    I was interested in painting, dancing, and clay modelling when I was between the ages of four and six. At that time, I had even received a prize for clay modelling.
                </p>
                <p>When I was 7 to 10 years old, I stopped being interested in all of my previous pastimes and started becoming more interested in playing basketball, game designing, reading, writing, singing, and video editing.</p>
                <p>When I was 11 to 13, I gave up most of my interests once more, but I persisted in reading and game designing. I also used to play tennis in 5th grade and practised taekwondo in 6th grade (till green belt). I also learnt how to play keyboard,
                    dholak and guitar, and I developed an interest in digital and vector graphics as well as sticker making.

                    <p>When I was 14 years old, I discovered how to solve a Rubik's cube and developed a strong interest in cubing and solving different kinds of cubes. In addition, I enjoyed playing badminton with my friends and cycling.</p>
                    <p>
                        I currently don't have any hobbies because I want to put more of my attention on myself. Every interest I had was a distraction because I would spend hours on it and put off doing other vital things.
                    </p>
                    <p>I still do coding and im learning calligraphy, but not on regular basis. (this is the reason why i am a little inconsistent on this website)</p>
