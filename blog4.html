            <h1>How I met my bestfriend</h1><br>
            <p>Today I'd like to share my story about how I met my best friend.</p>
            <p>Back in the year 2020 when I was in 6th grade and our annual exams got over, I didn't do much during the day because my 7th grade books had not arrived and the report card had not yet been distributed.</p>
            <p>In the evenings, I used to go to Taekwondo classes in my neighbourhood, where I made some friends. One of my friend who lived nearby, once invited me to hang out at her house.</p>
            <p>Someone rang the doorbell while we were playing Uno. She went to see who it was, then returned and said she had to go because Dhairya had called her to hang out at his house.</p>
            <p>We were perplexed as to what to do because I had just arrived at her house a few minutes before and someone had already invited her to his. She suggested me to come over his house too, to which I replied, "But I don't even know him :|."</p>
            <p>
                All I knew about him at the time was that his name was Dhairya Chaubey, he went to the same school as me, he was in the same class as me (but our sections were different), and he lived in my neighbourhood. Then I went back home to ask my mother if I could
                go to Dhairya's house to hang out, and to my surprise, she said yes because my mother and his mother were friends, and I had no idea. It was awkward for me as an introvert to go into someone's house, especially someone you didn't know
                and they didn't know you either.
            </p>
            <p>So, at my friend's request, I went to his house. He was surrounded by three of his friends, all of whom stood nearby and stared at me (which made me feel more awkward). I remained silent as they continued to play their board games. They eventually
                asked if I wanted to play with them, and I agreed. We played Business (a board game similar to monopoly), Uno, Hide and Seek, and other games, and I had a great time. I started going to his house every day, and if I didn't show up, he
                would come to my house to call me. Every day was exciting and fun with him until one day, our city went into lockdown due to an increase in COVID cases, and no one was allowed to leave their homes unless there was an emergency. This meant
                that I could not hang out with Dhairya as well. </p>
            <p>Despite the lockdown, we continued to message and call each other on a daily basis, discussing a wide range of topics and talking even when we were out of context. We got to know each other better and developed a better understanding during
                this time period.</p>
            <p>We realised we had a lot in common as we got to know each other, which is why we never ran out of topics to talk about. We had both supported one another in times of hardship and had been there for each other. We eventually became best friends.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I know it's been a while since I posted anything, but I'll be posting more articles in the near future.  Thank you for your time.</p>
