            <h1>How I broke friendship with my close friend</h1><br>
            <p>
                It is difficult to ignore a close friend, but it is even more difficult to break ways with or forget that person. Today I'd want to share my personal experiences and advise on how to forget someone close to you.
            </p>
            <p>There are numerous reasons why a person would desire to split with someone important to them. Maybe it's because of a quarrel or a disagreement, maybe it's because the person they used to talk with isn't behaving the same way they used to,
                or maybe they've found a better company than theirs, etc.</p><br>
            <p>I had a good friend, but because I'm not comfortable disclosing his true name, let's call him Bridge. Bridge and I instantly became friends since we were so similar. We both had the same favourite colour, food, song, movie, and so forth. We
                shared similar musical tastes and practically the same attitude and mentality - we were both outgoing, adventurous, and introverted.</p>
            <p>But then, after middle school, our personalities changed dramatically; I became more focused on my education and future, while he became more childish and gradually began to resemble a maniac.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He used to sit right next to me in every class. He used to doodle on my hand or snatch my digital watch to distract me when I was paying attention to my teacher's lecture.</p>
            <p>I disregarded it at first, but he gradually became more toxic. </p>
            <p>He began making fun of me and joking with me every minute, steadily eroding my self-esteem and reputation in class. His grades were awful! For example, if a test was for 20 marks, he would receive a score ranging from 1 to 8. He used to spend
                his days listening to music and cycling. He genuinely stopped his studies.</p>
            <p>As he began to lose his reputation in class, I began to lose mine as well because I was his friend. Things got worse when he pretended to be in a relationship with me to everybody.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to quit taking to him, but I lacked the courage to do so. I wanted to put an end to the false rumours about myself. This was all so dreadful, and I really needed advice.</p>
            <p>
                However, there was no one to assist me with this. So I took the initiative to talk to him about it all and explain why we should stop talking to each other. Instead of appreciating my decision, he begged, "Naina, please don't do something that will break
                me."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I was now enraged. I reasoned that if a person cannot respect and obey my decisions, he cannot be my friend. The last time I spoke to him was on his birthday, August 24, 2022, and after that, I began ignoring him and stopped talking to him.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was challenging on my first day because he sat next to me every day. I realised this because I used to reserve a seat for him by placing my bag on the chair where he would sit, and when he arrived, I would take my bag from that spot. So
                I stopped saving a seat for him to avoid sitting with him. What's more, guess what? Someone else found it empty and sat on it.</p>
            <p>
                When he noticed someone else seated in his seat, he asked him to get off. I merely pretended to look someplace else in order to avoid becoming involved in their talk, which I fortunately did not. He sought another location to sit, and that was the end
                of the day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>He still stared at me, but I always avoided eye contact with him, even though it was difficult to take my gaze away from him because I felt a little terrible on the inside for stopping talking to him for such a little reason, but as the days
                passed, Ignoring him became much easier. I hadn't spoken to him in a week, or even a month.</p>
            <p>My best friend (let's call him DC) used to tell me that Bridge had been depressed since I stopped talking to him, but I didn't believe him because I saw in class that he had formed a new friend circle and was enjoying the company of his new
                friends.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Things altered over the course of a few days. People realised Bridge was a liar, and I was able to restore my reputation. No one in our class likes him since he is an erratic student with poor grades who refuses to improve. This is how our
                friendship came to an end.</p>
