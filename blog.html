            <h1>My programming journey (2017-present)</h1><br>
            <p>
                I was captivated by the creating and creation of applications when I was 10-11 years old, when kids my age were engrossed in playing computer games, and I always wondered how these things worked, i.e. how these types of games are made.
            </p>
            <p>
                To discover more about behind-the-scenes of games, I searched on my computer for how to construct your own game and found a website called <a href="https://sploder.com">Sploder</a>, back when
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> was still in use. As a result, I began creating my own platformer games using the website's built-in themes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> was introduced to me in fifth grade in 2018. It was a programming language taught at our school, and I wanted to know more about it than what was in our textbook (because our book just gave
                us basic knowledge about it rather than going into details). I created a Scratch account and began building and publishing projects.</p>
            <p>
                I used to spend hours coding, experimenting, and learning from YouTube videos (especially
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnLearnScratchTutorials/featured">Learn Learn Scratch Tutorials</a> and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/griffpatch">Griffpatch</a>). I made several platformer games, animations, and so on. I am unfortunately left behind with no evidences anymore as I deleted my previous accounts :P
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to COVID, I had a lot of free time after online classes so I used to code in Scratch. My father decided to book online coaching for me to learn more about app and web development in 2020, after learning about my growing interest in computer science
                and aiming to persue Software Engineering. So he scheduled a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhiteHat_Jr">WhiteHatJr</a> demo session but to, be honest, the mentor didn't teach me anything new. So he enrolled me in a
                <a href="https://wizklub.com/">Wizklub</a> batch, which was far superior to WhiteHatJr; I learned
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockly">Blockly
                </a>, how to code games, how to construct web-applications, how to code an Alexa skill, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a self-taught web developer who spends aÂ lot of time making websites in 7th and 8th grade. I then chose to take a year off from coding and I am finally back after a year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now a high school student (I opted Science with Maths and Computer) and I am now learning Java at my school using BlueJ who is aiming to persue Software Engineering via IIT JEE.
