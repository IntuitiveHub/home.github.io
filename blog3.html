            <h1>A scene of a summer afternoon in India (essay)</h1><br>
            <p>
                The time of morning is a beautiful sight in the streets. Our moods are lifted by the beautiful and tranquil setting. As the day goes on, the temperature rises. People who are out start to return home in an effort to escape the stifling heat.
            </p>
            <p>The sun is really scrotching at the noon. It's the hottest in the afternoon. The ground is covered with sun's scathing beams, the heat is intolerable.</p>
            <p>India has a hot and sunny climate particularly in the afternoon. At this time of the day, carsand food carts are typically lining the streets.

            </p>
            <p>
                Workers and labourers work along hours on factories, farm, building sites,garbage disposal fascilities, and other locations despite of the intense heat of the sun.

            </p>
            <p>
                Following a full day of study, students generally take bus, van, rickshaw or other modes of transportation home from school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even animals seek out shaded spots to avoid the heat and protect themselves from the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purpose of controlling traffic, avoiding crowds and assuring saftety of all local citizens, police officers and cops are required to work for long shifts.
            </p>
            <p> For comfort during the time of day, people frequently consume popsicles and cold beverages.</p>
            <p>The making of lunch and dinner sometimes require people to go for shopping or buying groceries.</p>
            <p>
                People sit under air conditioners and coolers inside their homes to keep the interiors from becoming too hot.
            </p>

            <p>
                Children often venture outside to play with their buddies at parks.
            </p>
            <p>It's true that summer heat is more of a curse than a blessing. We feel sluggish and uncomfortable due to oppressive heat.</p>
